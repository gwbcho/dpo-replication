File Description:

This file is meant to contain all networks pertinent to the GAC algorithm. This includes the
Stochastic actors (AIQN and IQN), the value network, and the critic network. Note that, while they
maintain the same architecture, it is advisable that the value and critic netwok be DIFFERENT
classes, if for no other reason than legibility.
